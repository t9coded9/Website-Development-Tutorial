    <p>My favourite animal is Dog. Dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture. </p>
    <p>I started falling in love with dog since when I was small due to the fact that my dad love dog and we have upto 3 dogs as pet back then</p>

    <p> <b> Though in recent time I've been a bit detached from dog because it's costly to maintain but I still have strong love for them.</b> </p>
